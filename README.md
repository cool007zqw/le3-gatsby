## Deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

## To Dos:

1. Create a "View Source" link in the post footer that links to the markdown file on github
2. Create configurable "templates" in the frontmatter so different pages can have their own look and feel
    * Maybe a variable for "table of contents" that when enabled displays a table of contents with anchor links to each heading
        * must research a markdown processor for this
